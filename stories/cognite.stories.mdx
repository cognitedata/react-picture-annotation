# CogniteFileViewer

Cognite File Viewer is easiest way to view files in CDF with annotations displayed on top.

There are 2 ways to use this FileViewer, the simple way and the advanced way.

## Simple Viewer

The simple viewer will cover all the basic use case if you simply need to:

- Preview a file with all the annotations on top
- Zoom, pan, pinch, navigate across pages
- Get a callback when an annotation is clicked
- Download, search in a file
- Customize annotations' appearance, viewer controls etc.

If you need to modify the annotations from CDF and change them before supplying them to the viewer, or need to allow for add/edit annotation boxes, view the <a href="#advanced-viewer">Advanced Viewer Section</a>

To use the viewer simply import the `CogniteFileViewer` and supply it a `sdk` and a `file`, as show below. You will have access to all the other props in the <a href="#props">Props Section</a>.

**NOTE:** Avoid using `annotations` to supply additional annotations, this will be explained in the next section

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Simple">
    <CogniteFileViewer sdk={imgSdk} file={imgFile} />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Advanced Viewer

This is much more useful for people who want to:

- Modify annotations from CDF to add/edit/remove annotations and supply them to the viewer
- Allow for creating/editing annotation via drag-and-create process

In both cases, you would set `disableAutoFetch={true}` and supply `annotations` to the viewer. The sample code below will explain further

<Canvas>
  <Story story={AllowCustomization} />
</Canvas>

Here is a demo of the more advanced case with editing enabled and display an annotation selected at start.

<Canvas>
  <Story story={AllowControlledEditing} />
</Canvas>

## Pro Viewer

Sometimes you want various views to also share access to the same annotations, props as the viewer. Hence we have a `ContextProvider` and `FileViewer` seperated so you can add other components and allow them to change properties, access props and viewer callback with ease.

  <Story story={SplitContextAndViewer} />
</Canvas>

## Props

`CogniteFileViewer` supports and uses **ALL** props from `CogniteFileViewer.Provider` and `CogniteFileViewer.FileViewer` combined.

### `CogniteFileViewer.Provider` Props

<ArgsTable of={CogniteFileViewer.Provider} />

### `CogniteFileViewer.FileViewer` Props

<ArgsTable of={CogniteFileViewer.FileViewer} />

### Available context props/hooks from `CogniteFileViewer.Context`

<ArgsTable of={stubObserverObj} />

## Customized annotations

You can customize annotations via the advanced CogniteFileViewer. To do that, you need to pass an `allowCustomAnnotations` flag to the `<CogniteFileViewer>` component.

When the `allowCustomAnnotations` flag equals `true`, you can pass an additional argument in your annotation object - `mark`. Here you can define your custom annotation shape, as well as determine if an annotation is a highlight (which basically just adds padding to the box).

```
{
  mark: {
    backgroundColor?: string; // this must be in hex or string format
    strokeColor?: string;
    strokeWidth?: number;
    highlight?: boolean;
    draw?: (
      canvas: CanvasRenderingContext2D,
      x: number,
      y: number,
      width: number,
      height: number
    ) => void;
  }
}
```

The `draw()` function allows you to define a canvas and draw any shape you like. Example of what the `draw()` function might look like is in the story below.

<Canvas>
  <Story story={CustomizedAnnotations} />
</Canvas>

## Box and arrows

You can add an additional info box to every annotation, connected to it with an arrow.

### Customizing the box

To add an arrow box to the annotation, pass a `renderArrowPreview` field to the CogniteFileViewer. This component will get connected to the annotation with an arrow. You can style it however you want!
There is one info box per annotation, therefore you can pass `undefined` if you do not wish for the box to appear for a particular annotation.

### Offset of the arrow boxes

If you want to customize arrow boxes in other fields than the connected component, you can pass an optional `arrowPreviewOptions` prop:

```
  arrowPreviewOptions: {
    baseOffset?: { 
      x?: number, 
      y?: number 
    },
    customOffset?: {
      [annotationId]: {
        x?: number.
        y?: number
      }
    }
  }
```

- `baseOffset` field creates an offset for all of the rendered boxes. The reference point is the top left corner of an annotation. If it's not provided, the offset defaults to [-40, -40]
- `customOffset` customizes the offset for the particular boxes, identified by the ID of annotation they are connected to. It overwrites the `baseOffset` value

### Saving the position of the dragged box

You can drag all of the boxes around, but their positions will reset once the component rerenders. If you want to get the position where the arrow box was dragged to, you have to use `onArrowBoxMove` method:

```
  onArrowBoxMove = ({ annotationId: string|number, offsetX?: number, offsetY?: number }) => void
```

It is a callback that allows you to access the `offsetX` and `offsetY` for the dragged arrow box, identified by the `annotationId` field. 
You can store that value somewhere, and then pass it back to the `arrowPreviewOptions.customOffset[annotationId]` if you want to recreate it!
