# CogniteFileViewer

Cognite File Viewer is easiest way to view files in CDF with annotations displayed on top.

There are 2 ways to use this FileViewer, the simple way and the advanced way.

## Simple Viewer

The simple viewer will cover all the basic use case if you simply need to:

- Preview a file with all the annotations on top
- Zoom, pan, pinch, navigate across pages
- Get a callback when an annotation is clicked
- Download, search in a file
- Customize annotations' appearance, viewer controls etc.

If you need to modify the annotations from CDF and change them before supplying them to the viewer, or need to allow for add/edit annotation boxes, view the <a href="#advanced-viewer">Advanced Viewer Section</a>

To use the viewer simply import the `CogniteFileViewer` and supply it a `sdk` and a `file`, as show below. You will have access to all the other props in the <a href="#props">Props Section</a>.

**NOTE:** Avoid using `annotations` to supply additional annotations, this will be explained in the next section

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Simple">
    <CogniteFileViewer sdk={imgSdk} file={imgFile} />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Advanced Viewer

This is much more useful for people who want to:

- Modify annotations from CDF to add/edit/remove annotations and supply them to the viewer
- Allow for creating/editing annotation via drag-and-create process

In both cases, you would set `disableAutoFetch={true}` and supply `annotations` to the viewer. The sample code below will explain further

<Canvas>
  <Story story={AllowCustomization} />
</Canvas>

Here is a demo of the more advanced case with editing enabled and display an annotation selected at start.

<Canvas>
  <Story story={AllowControlledEditing} />
</Canvas>

## Pro Viewer

Sometimes you want various views to also share access to the same annotations, props as the viewer. Hence we have a `ContextProvider` and `FileViewer` seperated so you can add other components and allow them to change properties, access props and viewer callback with ease.

<Canvas>
  <Story story={SplitContextAndViewer} />
</Canvas>

## Props

`CogniteFileViewer` supports and uses **ALL** props from `CogniteFileViewer.Provider` and `CogniteFileViewer.FileViewer` combined.

### `CogniteFileViewer.Provider` Props

<ArgsTable of={CogniteFileViewer.Provider} />

### `CogniteFileViewer.FileViewer` Props

<ArgsTable of={CogniteFileViewer.FileViewer} />

### Available context props/hooks from `CogniteFileViewer.Context`

<ArgsTable of={stubObserverObj} />

## Customized annotations

You can customize annotations via the advanced CogniteFileViewer. To do that, you need to pass an `allowCustomAnnotations` flag to the `<CogniteFileViewer>` component.

When the `allowCustomAnnotations` flag equals `true`, you can pass an additional argument in your annotation object - `mark`. Here you can define your custom annotation shape, as well as determine if an annotation is a highlight (which basically just adds padding to the box).

```
{
  mark: {
    backgroundColor?: string; // this must be in hex or string format
    strokeColor?: string;
    strokeWidth?: number;
    highlight?: boolean;
    draw?: (
      canvas: CanvasRenderingContext2D,
      x: number,
      y: number,
      width: number,
      height: number
    ) => void;
  }
}
```

The `draw()` function allows you to define a canvas and draw any shape you like. Example of what the `draw()` function might look like is in the story below.

<Canvas>
  <Story story={CustomizedAnnotations} />
</Canvas>

## Box and arrows

You can add an additional info box to every annotation, connected to it with an arrow. To do so, use a `renderArrowPreview` prop and pass a component in it which will appear in a box connected to the annotation.

There is one info box per annotation, therefore you can pass `undefined` if you do not wish for the box to appear for a particular annotation.

If you want to customize arrow boxes in other fields than the connected component, you can pass an optional `arrowPreviewOptions` prop:

```
  arrowPreviewOptions: {
    baseOffset?: { 
      x?: number, 
      y?: number 
    }
  }
```

  <Story story={BoxAndArrows} />
